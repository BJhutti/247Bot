# 247 Bot

A discord.js bot that keeps track of users who send :247: in the general chat of a discord server.

## Functionality

### Leaderboard

The ```/leaderboard ``` command will show the current leaderboard. Users gain +1 when they send :247: at 2:47 (AM or PM PST).

### Streaks

```/streaks``` will show the current streak leaderboard. The streak is how many times in a row a user sent :247:,

### The Masta

Finally, ```/themasta``` will display the person with the highest streak of all time (Ties aren't allowed, only one masta).

### Misc

A gif is sent based on how many people sent :247:
- 0-2: field on fire
- 7-9: a nice farm tractor
- 10+: a magnificent harvest

Users who try to send :247: twice will get a crisp ðŸ‘Ž reaction from the bot.

```/ketchup``` sends an awesome ketchup gif.
